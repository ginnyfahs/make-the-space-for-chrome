## What does it take to elevate women every single day?
Make the Space is an answer to that question. Itâ€™s a Google Chrome extension that transforms every new tab into a challenge to elevate the women around you. You can find it in the Chrome store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/make-the-space/nljdbdamphnnppoohmjdplchkfnepamb).

The extension automatically appears when you open a new Chrome tab. It motivates 6 key actions for elevating other women:
1. *Think* - reading topical articles, staying informed of the issues
2. *Tweet* - speaking out, lifting up female voices
3. *Meet* - gathering with other women, building community 
4. *Evolve* - taking daily action to notice and encourage women around us
5. *Donate* - financially supporting organizations that expand female opportunity
6. *Apply* - staying aware of the professional landscape, always striving for more

I led the project's backend efforts, building our database and populating it with our custom content. I was also responsible for integrating with Twitter and owning the "Tweet" function, managing Heroku, using bootstrap for UI polishing, and submitting to the Chrome store using the Google Developer dashboard.
